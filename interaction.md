# Interaction Design - Codway IT Landing Page

## Core Interactions Inspired by Lugano Living Lab

### 1. Hero Section Interactions
- **Animated Text Reveal**: Text elements animate in with staggered timing using GSAP
- **Scroll-triggered Animations**: Elements appear and transform as user scrolls
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive elements respond to mouse hover with smooth transitions
- **Background Parallax**: Subtle parallax effect on background elements

### 2. Navigation Menu
- **Smooth Transitions**: Menu items animate in/out with staggered timing
- **Active State Indicators**: Underline animations for current page
- **Mobile Toggle**: Hamburger menu with smooth transformation to X
- **Dropdown Animations**: Subtle slide-down animations for menu items

### 3. Project Showcase Carousel
- **Infinite Scroll**: Smooth horizontal scrolling through projects
- **Hover Reveal**: Project details appear on hover with overlay animations
- **Navigation Arrows**: Custom animated arrows with pixel-grid effects
- **Auto-play**: Automatic progression with pause on hover

### 4. Statistics Counter
- **Animated Counting**: Numbers count up from 0 to target value
- **Staggered Animation**: Multiple counters animate in sequence
- **Scroll Trigger**: Animation starts when section enters viewport
- **Smooth Easing**: Natural easing curves for professional feel

### 5. Service Cards
- **3D Tilt Effect**: Cards tilt slightly on hover
- **Content Reveal**: Additional information slides up on hover
- **Image Scaling**: Background images scale subtly on interaction
- **Button Animations**: Arrow icons animate on hover state

### 6. Footer Interactions
- **Social Media Hover**: Icons animate with translate effects
- **Link Underlines**: Smooth underline animations on hover
- **Background Reveal**: SVG mask reveals on mouse movement
- **Contact Form**: Smooth form validation and submission feedback

## Animation Principles

### Timing & Easing
- Use cubic-bezier(0.625, 0.05, 0, 1) for main animations
- Stagger delays between 0.1s - 0.3s for sequential reveals
- Duration of 0.5s - 1s for most transitions

### Performance
- Use transform and opacity for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Implement proper cleanup in React useEffect hooks
- Use GSAP context for automatic animation management
- Optimize for 60fps performance

### Accessibility
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion settings
- Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
- Provide keyboard navigation alternatives
- Maintain focus management during animations

## Technical Implementation

### GSAP Integration
- Use useGSAP hook for automatic cleanup
- Register ScrollTrigger plugin for scroll animations
- Implement context-safe functions for event handlers
- Use refs for DOM element targeting

### React Best Practices
- Separate animation logic into custom hooks
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Follow component composition patterns

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Touch-friendly interactions for mobile devices
- Reduced motion on smaller screens
- Optimized animations for different screen sizes
